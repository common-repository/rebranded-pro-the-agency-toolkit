This is a total rebranding package for the Wordpress admin built for for agencies, designers and website builders. 

== Description ==

This is a total rebranding package for the Wordpress admin built for for agencies, designers and website builders. This plugin also protects essential parts of the Wordpress installation in order to create an awesome user experience for the client on the WP-admin dashboard. My other plugins (Super Simple Age Gate, Super Simple Site Offline, Simple Analytics Tag) hook right in! So it feels as if they are part of Re:Branded. Or are they?

= Re:Branded contains the following features: =
* Display your agency information in the WP-admin so the client can order content or revisions
* Present your custom documentation in a clean and clear way
* Disable functions of Wordpress that the website doesn't need
* Manage the built in Client role so that the client can only access what they need
* Switch users so you can take a look what the client can and cannot see or do
* Remove the WP-admin bar from the homepage when logged in or just replace it with a tiny label on the right side for easy access
* Colour the address bar on mobile browsers

== Installation ==
1. Upload the unpacked folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the settings menu and activate the plugin.
4. If you go back to your WP-admin menu you'll see that it's neat and clean. Go to the Rebranded menu to add back what you will need.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I use this plugin for a website that I sell to the client? =
No problemo!

= Does it contain paid functions? =
Nope.

= Does it come with Wordpress documentation? =
No, it doesn't You'll have to write your own since every custom WP build is different it would be nearly impossible to do so. But if you wrote one once, you can reuse it ofcourse.

== Screenshots ==
1. This is a view of the documentation page with your logo and a welcome message on top and the docs below. There is also a quick link on the side if you have more than one manual.
2. The page with your agency details. Just in case.
3. Fill out your agency details.
4. The settings page where you can change things in your and the clients wp-admin panel.
5. Also under settings you'll find the client-role permissions.
6. The documentation is easy to add, remove and edit.
